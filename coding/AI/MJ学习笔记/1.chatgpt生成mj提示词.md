I need some help generating AI art prompts on a software called Midjourney. First, I am going to explain what Midjourney is and what it can do. 
One of the widely used text-to-image AI services available on the internet is Midjourney. Through Discord, a chat application, users can interact with the bot to produce images with just a few straightforward commands, without the need for coding skills. The results are visually attractive images that are easy to create.
You can Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a {{glossary.Command}}. Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor user info, and perform other helpful tasks.
The /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description (known as a {{glossary.Prompt}}).
The Midjourney Bot works best with clear and specific sentences that describe the finished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Rather than providing specific instructions, such as 'Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils,' try describing what you want in a more straightforward manner, such as 'Vibrant orange California poppies illustrated with colored pencils.
Generating an image activates the free Midjourney trial.Trial users can make roughly 25 Jobs before needing to subscribe. A Job is any action that uses the Midjourney Bot. Jobs include using the /imagine command to create a grid of images, upscaling images, or creating image variations, all using your free trial time. Use the /info command to check your Fast Time Remaining to see your remaining Trial time.
Do you understand ? Say "yes" if you understand
```

### 告诉它输出的格式

  ```txt
  I want you to use this formula to write Midjourney Prompts: 
  (image we're prompting), (5 descriptive keywords or phrases),(photorealistic style) , (camera model and lens), (lighting) ,(Environment)
  Do you understand this formula? Say "yes" if you understand

  （我们要提示的图像），（5个描述性的关键词或短语），（照片写实风格），（相机型号和镜头），（光线），（环境）
  ```

- 所有关键词的分类

  ```txt
  (style) (artists) (Medium) (Environment)
  (Color) (Mood) (Composition) (camera model and lens)

  (style) 风格
  (artists) 艺术家
  (Medium) 媒介（在艺术中指作品使用的材料或技术，如油画、水彩、数字画等）
  (Environment) 环境
  (Color) 颜色
  (Mood) 情绪/氛围
  (Composition) 构图
  (camera model and lens) 相机型号和镜头
  ```

### 输入主题

  ```txt
  Using the formula provided, write me a prompt for [主题],and translated into Chinese at the end
  ```

  2023.7.25更新，由于gpt算法更新了，如果返回prompt不是一整完整的prompt，而是隔行分隔开的prompt，那么第三步可以用下面的指令。

  ```txt
  Using the formula provided, write me a prompt for [主题],don‘t text "Image:" "Camera model and lens:"and 
  ```
  
### 让chatgpt多组思路

  ```txt
  write me 4 Midjourney prompts of [主题],and translated into Chinese at the end
  ```

  同理，如果返回prompt不是一整完整的prompt，而是隔行分隔开的prompt，那么用下面的指

  ```txt
  write me 4 Midjourney prompts of [主题],don‘t text "Image:" "Camera model and lens:"and so on,and translate
  ```

### 改变风格

  ```txt
  I'd like to change the formula to: 
  (image we're prompting), (5 descriptive keywords or phrases), (Minimalist style), (illustration,Vector) ,(Color),(Composition)
  Type yes if you understand
  ```

  ```txt
  write me 4 Midjourney prompts of [Gundam robot],and Change the style to cyberpunk,and translated into Chinese at the end

  给我写4个《高达机器人》提示，把风格改成赛博朋克，最后翻译成中文
  ```
